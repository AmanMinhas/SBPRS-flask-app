It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting.

For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting.

       "3      I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

I used it with the Moisturizing unscented shampoo and feel like the combo of the two is keeping my hair very healthy. I've also noticed less frizz as well. I've only used it a couple times but I only wash my hair once ever 4-5 days or so. Scalp isn't greasy and hair isn't dried out. Curls aren't too frizzy either!   \n",

I thought they could easily be bent back in shape, but that isn't the case. I could iron them down, but I won't waste my time. For the price, it's not worth the purchase in my opinion.

First, the color of the sunflowers is more like a red/orange than yellow. Second, the petals on the sunflowers themselves were all bent. I thought they could easily be bent back in shape, but that isn't the case. I could iron them down, but I won't waste my time. For the price, it's not worth the purchase in my opinion. Sorry, this swag missed the mark for me.  \n",
